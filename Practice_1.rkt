;;Question 2
;;Purpose: Consumes 3 integers and determines whether 
;;they are within an interval of 2
;;Contract: integer integet integer -> boolean
(define (near? a b c)
  (<= (- (max a b c) (min a b c)) 2))

;;Tests for near?

;;Question 3
;;Purpose: consumes a list of symbols and 
;;returns the number of occurrences of the symbol x in the list
;;(list symbol) -> integer

;;Question 5
;;Purpose: consumes two arguments that are lists of equal length,return a list 
;;that contains two-element lists from

;;Question 6
;;Purpose: define my-picture â€” bind it to the number next to your picture

;;Purpose: Define minutes-spent as the number of minutes 
;;you spent on your homework.
